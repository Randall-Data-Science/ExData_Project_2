# Hadley Wickham has developed a number of important packages for R includding 
# ggplot2 as well as plyr and reshape for data manipulation. Two of the latest 
# packages for data manipulation are dplyr and tidyr. 
#
# Dplyr provides functionalities analagous to SQL statements like SELECT, JOIN,
# WHERE, ORDER BY. 
#
# Tidyr transforms data analogous to database theory distinctions between
# different normal forms -- melt() makes tables long, spread() makes them wide.
#
# It is also worth noting that the dplyr package imports the magrittr package
# which intorduces the %>% operator for piping data and functions.
